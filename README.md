As a member of the Security Awareness Team, my task was to help our staff learn how to identify and report phishing security threats, as it was one of the most common threats facing organisations. I had to dig a lot of information on Phishing to better understand it and present a concise simulation of the relevant information. Humans are said to be the weakest point in any organisation's security structure and so building awareness through phishing simulations campaigns is one of the effective ways to build employees as a human firewall.

The first task was to analyse suspected phishing emails. A quick review of the email showed that it had a suspicious source email address "mastercardsIT@gmail.com". For a company like Mastercard using a Gmail mail server platform is quite suspicious. Again, the name is mixed with upper and lowercase with an 's' at the end of MasterCard. A quick reminder is always to try and google the company in question to find specific verified public details about them. The recipient email looks suspicious as well as it seems anonymous and unspecific. The urgency of the request is also a reg flag to look at. There are email structure inconsistencies, and spelling mistakes, which clearly is a lazy phishing email job done by the attackers. Nonetheless, there are always susceptible employees out there who will fall for anything and so creating awareness is important. <br/>
  
A more believable phishing email was designed for training purposes. This email is more structured, grammatically correct and spelt accurately. It uses hyperlinks to mask the real malicious source link from the victim. It also uses a believable confidentiality disclaimer to add legitimacy to the mail. <br/>

The next task was interpreting phishing simulation results and identifying the most vulnerable teams. Based on the data, the HR and MArketing teams were the most vulnerable, with a phishing success rate of 75% and 38%, the highest among all the teams. The IT and Reception teams, on the other hand, were the lowest, with no phishing success rate. Invariably, HR's click-through rate translates into its success rate which is alarming and needs critical attention. Below is a PowerPoint presentation providing awareness and training for the two teams that appear to be most susceptible. This will help improve the security awareness of the teams.<br />
